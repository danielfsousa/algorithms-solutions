'''
Selection in two sorted arrays.
Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[], of lengths n1 and n2​
and an integer 0 <= k < n1 + n2, design an algorithm to find
a key of rank k. The order of growth of the worst case running
time of your algorithm should be log⁡ n, where n = n1 + n2.

    Version 1: n1=n2 (equal length arrays) and k=n/2 (median).
    Version 2: k=n/2 (median).
    Version 3: no restrictions.
